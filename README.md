# Face-Mask-Recognition-1.0
<h2>Face Mask Recognition using Machine Learning and OpenCV</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
The whole world today, is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. People are 
using various measures to control the spread of Corona virus. There are so 
many vital measures which are needed to fight against COVID-19 and one 
of such most important is face mask. Lots of research and studies on 
COVID-19 are still going on. Studies have also proved that wearing a face 
mask remarkably reduces the problem of viral transmission. Also, a person 
wearing a face mask recognizes a sense of protection. At our homes, we 
consciously take care of each and everything but when it comes to public 
places like offices, malls, colleges, etc., it becomes somewhat challenging 
to maintain the safety of people. However, it is not feasible to manually 
check whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. Technology comes 
into picture here. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence consist of 
various technologies which provide effective solutions to complex 
problems in different areas. In order to prevent the spread of Corona virus, 
I have made an attempt to develop a face mask recognition system using 
machine learning. This is an effective system to detect a face mask. It is 
capable of recognizing masked and unmasked faces. By the development 
of this system, one can detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not. If 
the person is not wearing a face mask, then system will show some 
message like ‘No Mask ‘otherwise it will show ‘Mask detected’ message.
<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
Real time mask detection can solve the monitoring issues in geographies 
with high population. Its hectic to manually detect someone wearing their 
face mask or not in a public place. This machine learning system detect if a 
person is wearing a face mask or not. If the person is not wearing a face 
mask, then system will show some message like ‘No Mask ‘otherwise it 
will show ‘Mask detected’ message.
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
The main objective of “Face mask recognition” project is to provide some 
effective technology for preventing the spread of Corona virus. Primary 
objectives behind the development of this system are as follows: -
• Prevent the spread of Corona virus by promoting the use of face masks 
with the help of effective technology to detect the face mask.
• Help to take necessary precautions for the safety of society by predicting 
the future outbreaks of COVID-19. 
• Ensure a safe working environment. 
• Save the lives of people.
<h3>what this model do:</h3>
• Initially we will capture an image through webcam to detect person’s 
face. 
• Extraction of images from frames. 
• Then face mask detector will be loaded. 
• Operation on images will be performed for detection by Image 
preprocessing. 
• Respective results will be converted into image frames. 
• If person is wearing mask properly then system will display message like 
“Thank u for wearing mask” with green signal. • If the person is not 
wearing mask or not wearing in proper way, then system will display 
message like “please wear mask” with red signal
<h3>framework used:</h3>
OpenCV: The Standard definition of OpenCV (Open-Source Computer 
Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning 
software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for 
computer vision applications and also to accelerate the use of machine 
perception in the commercial products.
<h3>conclusion:</h3>
• In this pandemic situation, where whole world is dreaming to return to 
normal routine, this system will play effective role in monitoring the use of 
face masks at workplaces. 
• By the development of this system, we can detect the mask on one’s face 
and allow his entry in the workplace. 
• This system also contributes to public healthcare, as it helps in keeping 
environment healthy. 
• This system can be aptly used in public areas with embedded systems for 
application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places 
to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
